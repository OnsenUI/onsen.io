## Releasing to Production
This repository is set up on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OnsenUI/onsen.io) to automatically build with every commit. Commits to `master` are automatically deployed to the staging website at `s.onsen.io`. To deploy to production, merge `master` into the `production` branch. Typically this merge is done through a pull request on GitHub, even if you immediately merge it yourself. Once merged, CircleCI will automatically deploy everything in the `production` branch.

## How to contribute

We will happily accept contributions to the onsen.io website. However, it is much more likely that it is another repository that you want to make your pull request to. This repository contains the Onsen UI marketing materials, and brings in most of the rest of the content from other repositories.

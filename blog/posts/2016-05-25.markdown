### Giro D'Italia - one of the most prestigious Cycling Contests in the World

Along with the Tour de France and Vuelta a España, the Giro makes up one of the cycling's prestigious three-week-long Grand Tours. Giro d'Italia's tour changes each year, but each race consists of least two time trials, and a passage through the mountains of the Alps, including the Dolomites. Cyclists' durance is put to test throughout a 23-day period that includes 2 rest days.

### Onsen UI behind the official Giro d'Italia app's beautiful interface

[Logicweb](http://www.logicweb.it), the Italian software company behind the Giro d'Italia app commissioned by Havas Sports&Entertainment, shared their success story with us, after choosing [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io) as their preferred tool. Since they were already experienced with Cordova, they researched [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io), [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and [Framework 7](http://framework7.io/), looking for a light, yet complete framework. As they wanted to integrate some previously created (mainly jQuery) components from the Giro D'Italia website easily, [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io) was their first and only choice.

[Onsen UI](https://onsen.io)'s Sliding Menu, along with the Navigator concept brought the perfect solution they were looking for, and the work was easily distributed among the team members.

### Technology behind the most downloaded app in the App Stores

In the past, Logicweb used Framework 7 and a proprietary framework for what concerns Cordova app development. For the Giro d’Italia app, they have used Angular 1.5.3, jQuery 2.2.2, and [Signals](https://github.com/photonstorm/typescript-signals) for the events management.
All their projects are made with Typescript and for the Android version of their apps, they use Crosswalk.

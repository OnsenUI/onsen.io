We are very proud to take part in Europe’s Largest Angular Conference, [AngularConnect](http://angularconnect.com/2016). Onsen UI Team is getting ready for a 2-day, multi-track conference that brings together world’s leading Angular experts, including the core Angular team at Google. If you are in London as well next week, make sure to get in touch with us ([best through our community forum](https://community.onsen.io/)) and meet us there! See you on [September 27th and 28th](http://angularconnect.com/2016).

<!-- more -->

This year AngularConnect brings  practical, thought-provoking content with high quality workshops, games and chill-out spaces. Entertainment (with delicious food and drinks) is guaranteed. 2 days of talks, Q&A sessions, community networking and partying - can it even get better than that?

## What to expect from this year's AngularConnect?

AngularConnect will open with a keynote from Miško Hevery, the creator of the Angular framework, and Jules Kramer, the TPM on the Angular team. After the best welcoming committee announces the opening of the event, there will be 5 parallel tracks to choose from, and they will run for 2 full days! Those ready for immediate action can also participate in a Hackathon.


## Greatest value - and then some!

In addition to best content from Angular experts, you'll be able to enjoy networking over the 80s themed after-party with greatest hits, karaoke, as well as retro computer and arcade games. To assure you'll be well rested for the party, you'll be able to rest in the chillout room and even attend meditation sessions. And if you need more help relaxing, ask Onsen UI Team for insider practices of traditional Japanese zazen meditation.

We're looking forward to meeting you at [AngularConnect](http://angularconnect.com/2016)!

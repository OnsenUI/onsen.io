Hi, this is Hosoi of Monaca team.

This time I will write a short report about Raspberry Pi case I made with LEGO.

<!-- こんにちは、Monacaチームの細井です。
まだまだ、クソ暑い日が続きますが、皆様いかがお過ごしでしょうか。

さて今回は、夏休みの宿題っぽい感じで、「LEGOでRaspberry Piのケースを作ってみた」という内容をお送りします。 -->


#### Objective

One of my colleague in Monaca team asked me to make a case for Raspberry Pi he bought the other day.
I decided to create it with LEGO. I also decided to give it Monaca-ish feel.


#### What I made

I don't know the official name, but I named it "Cordova-kun."

For this case, I needed to make it rectangular shape, although Cordova logo originally is a cubic shape.

Face of Cordova-kun becomes a lid.

It fits the default Raspberry Pi case perfectly.

#### More details

I placed green and red parts to represent raspberry.
The person sitting on the chair is an engineer who is making a Cordova application.

You can see holes on a side and the back for Raspberry Pi's outlets.

It's also possible to directly connect other cables through the door.
The red wires you see are connected to thermometer and hygrometer.
Cordova-kun will tell the temperature and humidity in the office.


#### In the end

I feel like I use different parts of brain when I make LEGO occasionally.
Though, I'm not allowed to play LEGO while working in the office, it's always good to have a playful mind as an Asial employee.

### Vue.js

> Before reading this section, we suggest you reading [Getting Started](../index.html) and [Fundamentals](../fundamentals.html) to grasp the basics of Onsen UI. Don't worry, it won't take more than 5 minutes.

Vue bindings for Onsen UI (VueOnsen) provide Vue 2 components and directives that wrap the core Web Components and expose a Vue-like API to interact with them.

In this guide we explain how to set up Onsen UI + Vue and some fundamental tips to get started.

#### Download Vue bindings

Vue bindings are distributed in [`vue-onsenui` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-onsenui). You can download it via NPM:

```sh
$ npm install onsenui vue-onsenui --save-dev
```

It is also available [via CDN](https://unpkg.com/vue-onsenui). The [latest core release](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/releases) contains Vue bindings as well.

#### Setup Vue bindings

You can load Onsen UI with normal `<script></script>` and `<link>` tags as follows:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="onsenui.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="onsen-css-components.css">

<script src="vue.js"></script>
<script src="onsenui.js"></script>
<script src="vue-onsenui.js"></script>
```

Or, you can import `VueOnsen` from `node_modules/vue-onsenui` with a module bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

```js
// Webpack CSS import
import 'onsenui/css/onsenui.css';
import 'onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.css';

// JS import
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueOnsen from 'vue-onsenui'; // This already imports 'onsenui'

Vue.use(VueOnsen);
```

Notice how `VueOnsen` is used as a plugin for Vue in the last line (this is already done automatically if `window.Vue` exists). Alternatively, you can use `require` instead of ES6 imports.

#### Using Vue CLI

Onsen UI provides ready-to-go templates for Vue CLI as well:

  * __Cordova__: [vue-cordova-webpack](https://github.com/OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack)
  ```bash
  $ vue init OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack hello-world
  ```
  * __Progressive Web App__: [vue-pwa-webpack](https://github.com/OnsenUI/vue-pwa-webpack)
  ```bash
  $ vue init OnsenUI/vue-pwa-webpack hello-world
  ```

These templates bundle Onsen UI + Vue bindings with unit & e2e testing solutions compatible with Onsen UI.

#### List of Vue Components

<a href="/v2/api/vue/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/guide/vue_components.png" alt="Vue Components"></a>

[Vue Components API Reference](/v2/api/vue/) lists up all the Vue Components included in Onsen UI.

Also, [Kitchensink app](https://onsenui.github.io/vue-onsenui-kitchensink/) will be useful for determining how components behave. [See the code here](https://github.com/onsenui/vue-onsenui-kitchensink).

#### Hello World with Vue

To get started, let’s create a simple Hello World application. The following sample code is a Vue version of Onsen UI HelloWorld.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="onsenui.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="onsen-css-components.css">
  <script src="vue.js"></script>
  <script src="onsenui.js"></script>
  <script src="vue-onsenui.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <template id="main-page">
    <v-ons-page>
      <v-ons-toolbar>
        <div class="center">Title</div>
      </v-ons-toolbar>

      <p style="text-align: center">
        <v-ons-button @click="$ons.notification.alert('Hello World!')">
          Click me!
        </v-ons-button>
      </p>
    </v-ons-page>
  </template>

  <div id="app"></div>

  <script>
    var vm = new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      template: '#main-page'
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<div id="app"></div>` node is where Vue will render the content into (`el` property in the constructor).

This is a pure ES5 example, although normally it's advisable to use ES2015 and [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) since it allows `*.vue` format.

For more information about Vue itself, we recommend reading the official [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

#### Understanding Vue Components

Having a general idea about how everything is implemented could be useful in some situations. This is a brief explanation about how Vue Componentes for Onsen UI work.

These components are simple wrappers around inner [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements) in most of the cases. This means that a Vue Component takes some props and translate them into DOM properties, DOM attributes or method calls for the Onsen UI core. It also listens for native events and fires the corresponding Vue events. If you inspect the DOM you will likely see a bunch of `ons-*` components without `v-*` prefix (these are real HTMLelements). You can have a look at the implementation [here](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/master/bindings/vue/src/components).

Since `v-ons-*` components compiles into `ons-*` DOM element, you can use this knowledge to style your component with tag names as well.

#### VOnsPage Compilation

`v-ons-page` component compiles into `ons-page` custom element. This element, at the same time, processes its content and filters scrollable and fixed elements. Scrollable content is moved into a special `div.page__content` wrapper. This behavior might create issues under some specific situations, like using `v-for` with asynchronous data. To avoid any possible issue, __manually providing a `div.content` element is recommended__:

```html
<v-ons-page>
  <v-ons-toolbar></v-ons-toolbar>

  <div class="content">
    <!-- Scrollable content here -->
    <v-ons-input></v-ons-input>
    <div v-for="item in asyncAjaxItems"></div>
  </div>

  <!-- Fixed content here -->
  <v-ons-fab></v-ons-fab>
</v-ons-page>
```

See also [Components Compilation](../compilation.html) section for more details about this.

#### The $ons object

The original [`ons` object](../fundamentals.html#the-ons-object) is not available in the global scope in Vue applications. Instead, it is provided in every Vue instance as `this.$ons` through Vue's protoytpe:

```html
<v-ons-button @click="$ons.notification.alert('Hi there!')">
  Click me
</v-ons-button>
```

#### Event Handling

DOM events fired by Onsen UI elements are translated into Vue events in the corresponding components. For example, `v-ons-navigator` can handle a `postpush` event with `@postpush="..."`.

From `vue@2.4.0` and `vue-onsenui@2.1.0` onwards, native DOM events are passed down to the children. This means that `<v-ons-checkbox @change="...">` will work __without__ `native` modifier. Prior to these versions, `@change.native="..."` syntax is required. Note that these events are still DOM events and, as such, Vue DevTools won't show any Vue event for these.

The exception to this is `click` event, which is turned into a Vue event in some components. The reason is that `click` event is used to override default behaviors:

```html
<v-ons-back-button @click.prevent="pageStack.splice(1)"></v-ons-back-button>
```

The previous example overrides the `v-ons-back-button` default behavior, popping 1 single page, and resets the stack to the first page instead. The `prevent` modifier is just calling `$event.preventDefault()`.

Additionally, components that are capable of handling Cordova's `backbutton` event (Android's back button), can listen for this event with `@deviceBackButton` handler.

```
<v-ons-dialog @deviceBackButton="$event.callParentHandler()"></v-ons-dialog>
```

More information about this event in the original [Cordova-specific Features](../cordova.html#device-back-button) section.

#### Inputs and v-model

Input components in Onsen UI (such as `v-ons-input` or `v-ons-checkbox`) support Vue’s `v-model` directive:

```html
<v-ons-input v-model="something"></v-ons-input>
```

The only exceptions are `v-model` modifiers, which are not supported by custom components as of `vue@2.3`, unfortunately. However, there is a workaround for the most important one, the `lazy` modifier:

```html
<v-ons-input v-model="something" model-event="change"></v-ons-input>
```

This will update the model on `change` events instead of `input` (default). The rest ofthe modifiers can be easily implemented in other ways.

It is also possible to bind arrays to `v-ons-checkbox` or `v-ons-switch` just like normal `<input type="checkbox">`, and make radio groups with `v-model` for `v-ons-radio`.

#### Vue Bindings FAQ

##### How to set up global Onsen UI options?

The main guide describes [how to disable or set some global features](../faq.html) _"right after including `onsenui.js` in the app"_. This means that it must take effect before any component is rendered. Since `ons` object is not provided globally, we need to use `$ons` object at the very first possible location:

```
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueOnsen from 'vue-onsenui';
Vue.use(VueOnsen);

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: h => h(...),
  beforeCreate() {
    this.$ons.disableAutoStyling(); // Or any other method
  }
})
```

This way, changes take effect before any component is rendered.

##### How to pass data to the next page in the navigator?

Navigator's pages are sibling elements, which means that communication among them in Vue is fairly challenging. [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) is a good solution for this, but not the only one. When you push a new page component and want to add some initial data, you can simply extend it:

```
import nextPage from 'nextPage.vue';
// ...

pageStack.push({
  extends: nextPage,
  data() {
    return {
      myCustomDataHere: 42
    };
  }
})
```

In order to send data back to the previous page before popping, any of Vue's methods for [non parent-child communication](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Non-Parent-Child-Communication) works.

##### Can I use Vuex with Onsen UI?

Definitely yes. Vuex is a good solution for components communication. If you have too many props and events up and down, Vuex may be a good fit. For an example of Onsen UI + Vue + Vuex, see [kitchensink app](https://frandiox.github.io/vue-onsenui-kitchensink/).

##### What about vue-router?

Onsen UI provides its own routing components: [`v-ons-navigator`](/v2/api/vue/v-ons-navigator.html), [`v-ons-tabbar`](/v2/api/vue/v-ons-tabbar.html) and [`v-ons-splitter`](/v2/api/vue/v-ons-splitter.html). These components can be mixed in many ways to achieve the desired route pattern. This is in general completely enough for mobile SPA, so there is no need to plug an external router.

However, for those who really want to integrate vue-router, it is fully compatible with Onsen UI. It simply has to be integrated with the three routing components mentioned above.

  * __Splitter__:
    For `v-ons-splitter`, simply put your `router-view` in the place where `v-ons-page` components are normally located. In other words, inside `v-ons-splitter-content` or `v-ons-splitter-side`.

    ```
    <v-ons-splitter>
      <v-ons-splitter-side>...</v-ons-splitter-side>

      <v-ons-splitter-content>
        <router-view></router-view>
      </v-ons-splitter-content>
    </v-ons-splitter>
    ```

  * __Tabbar__:
    `v-ons-tabbar` accepts a slots syntax that allows us to include `router-view` in the pages slot. Also, `v-ons-tab` default behavior must be overriden in the `click` handler in order to let the router do the job.

    ```
    <v-ons-tabbar>
      <router-view slot="pages"></router-view>
      <v-ons-tab v-for="name in ['Home', 'Settings']" :key="name"
        :label="name"
        :active="$route.name === name"
        @click.prevent="$router.push({name})"
      ></v-ons-tab>
    </v-ons-tabbar>
    ```

  * __Navigator__: In this case we don't need `<router-view>` at all. The router simply has to decide what's going to be the next page stack for the navigator, and the latter will do all the job (transitions, events, etc.):

    ```
    template: `
      <div id="app">
        <v-ons-navigator swipeable
          :page-stack="pageStack"
          :pop-page="goBack"
        ></v-ons-navigator>
      </div>
    `,
    methods: {
      goBack() {
        this.$router.push({ name: this.$route.matched[this.$route.matched.length - 2].name });
      }
    },
    created() {
      const mapRouteStack = route => this.pageStack = route.matched.map(m => m.components.default);
      mapRouteStack(this.$route);
      this.$router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => mapRouteStack(to) && next());
    }
    ```

    Notice that the previous example is adding __every__ route to the Navigator's page stack. It assumes all the routes have a valid page (`v-ons-page`) as their default component. If this is not your case, simply filter out the routes you don't need.

    Once the router gives the new page stack to the Navigator, this one compares the current stack with the previous one. If the number of pages/routes has decreased and the top page has changed, it will perform a 'popPage' transition. Otherwise it will be 'pushPage'.

    Due to this, going back in the browser history (`$router.go(-1)`) to a deeper route will push a page rather than popping. Therefore, going back in the history with the `v-ons-back-button` is not very recommended unless you have extra logic in your router to avoid unwanted behaviors.
    In this example, the `v-ons-back-button` components runs `goBack` method, which is simply pushing the parent route (asumming it is the previous `v-ons-page`) instead of going back in the history. This behavior will likely fit most mobile apps.

    For a more complete example of `v-ons-navigator` with `vue-router`, have a look at [this repository](https://github.com/frandiox/onsenui-vue-router).

### Migration from Onsen UI 1.x

Onsen UI 1.x was dependent on AngularJS 1.x, while Onsen UI 2.x is built on top of Web Components and is framework agnostic. However, we do provide AngularJS bindings to support the cool features of this framework.

In this guide, we will briefly explain how to migrate the code of your apps from Onsen UI 1.x to Onsen UI 2.x + AngularJS bindings. If you rather want to use with [Angular 2](/v2/docs/angular2.html) or even [React](/v2/docs/react.html) and other frameworks, please take a look into [docs for each frameworks](/v2/docs/). They share the same core, which means you can still use the same knowledge, components and style definitions.

Within the provided Onsen UI 2 package, you will find `onsenui.js` as well as `angular-onsenui.js`, the latter standing for the mentioned bindings. It does not include AngularJS itself anymore. First of all, you need to update the included files in your `index.html` in the following way:

```
<script src="path/to/onsenui.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/angular.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/angular-onsenui.js"></script>
```

That is the first and main change for the migration process. Now, if you try to run your app you will probably find some console errors due to inexistent methods and objects. The reason is that for Onsen UI 2 we have updated and improved the API to make it more comfortable for developers. Basically, in most of the cases all you will need to do is replacing some method names and use the newly introduced properties instead of old method calls.

In the following we summarize a list of common changes that you will probably face. In case you have a different problem, please have a look at [Onsen UI 2 reference](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1.html) and check the new names of the API. In case you cannot find an answer you can also ask in our [community forum](https://community.onsen.io/).

##### General:

* Onsen UI 2.0 introduces the new Automatic Styling feature. This will make your Onsen UI iOS-like apps to be displayed with Material Design styles on Android platforms by default. To disable this just call `ons.disableAutoStyling();` right after including `onsenui.js` in your `index.html`.
* Some CSS-only components have been changed. Perhaps you need to update your styles with the [new ones](http://components2.onsen.io/).
* Every `component.setX(...)` or `component.isX()` method has been removed. Use `X` property instead (CamelCase). Example: `myCarousel.setDisabled(true);` => `myCarousel.disabled = true;`.
* `getDeviceBackButtonHandler()`-like methods have been removed. Use `onDeviceBackButton` properties instead. Example: `myNavigator.onDeviceBackButton = function() {};`.


##### [ons-navigator](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/ons-navigator.html)

* `getCurrentPage` method has been removed. Use `topPage` (HTMLElement) property instead: `myNavigator.getCurrentPage();` => `myNavigator.topPage;`
* `getPages()` method has been removed. Use `pages` property (HTMLCollection) instead: `myNavigator.getPages();` => `myNavigator.pages;`
* `options.onTransitionEnd` has been renamed to `options.callback`.

##### [ons-tabbar](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/tabbar.html)

* Removed `persistent` and `no-reload` attributes for tabs. These behaviors are now always applied by default.


##### [ons-list](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/list.html)

* CSS for this component has been updated. It's recommended to check the new reference, especially the new `modifiers` (longdivider, nodivider, etc.).
* Optionally, `ons-list-item` can be restructured with `left`, `center` and `right` elements instead of using `ons-col` and `ons-row` or custom CSS.


##### [ons-carousel](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/ons-carousel.html)

* `setActiveCarouselItemIndex()` method has been renamed to `setActiveIndex()`.
* `getActiveCarouselItemIndex()` method has been renamed to `getActiveIndex()`.


##### [ons-button](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/ons-button.html)

* Spinner related methods have been removed. This can be achieved by simple custom CSS.


##### ons-scroller

This directive has been removed. You can use a `div` element with simple CSS to achieve the same behavior:

```
.scroller {
  display: block;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: scroll;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  -ms-overflow-style: none;
  -ms-scroll-snap-type: mandatory;
}
```

#### Removing AngularJS?

In case you want to also remove AngularJS dependency from your project, you may need to do something else:

* `var` attribute works only for AngularJS. Use `id` instead and get the element with `getElementById` or `querySelector`. Example. `var myNavigator = document.getElementById('my-navigator'); myNavigator.pushPage(...);`
* Listeners such as `ons-prepush` attributes work only for AngularJS. Use normal JavaScript event listeners instead. Example: `document.addEventListener('prepush', function(event) {});
* `ons-sliding-menu` and `ons-split-view` directives work only for AngularJS. Use [`ons-splitter` component](https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular1/splitter.html) instead.
